I spent probably equal amounts of time implementing functionality
and refactoring my compiler to add some python OO flair.
This one was fairly difficult. I did spend too much time on any
one part. I was not able to get the hidden Multiple Parameters 
test to pass so that's a bummer. I'm sure I'll get good one day.
